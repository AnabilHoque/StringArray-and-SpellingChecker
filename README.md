# Creating a StringArray class and implementing a spelling checker program
A StringArray class (i.e. a Dynamic Array that can store strings) is implemented and used for the Spelling Checker program. <br /> <br />
The spelling checker program allows two options, either to take a line of text as input from the terminal or read 
a file, and then check whether the spelling of each word is correct. <br /> <br />
In both cases, the program provides a list of possible corrections to each incorrectly spelt word based on a 
combination of Levenshtein distance and frequency of use of the suggested correction. The text with corrections is then displayed
on the terminal, and if initially the option to read a file was chosen, then the corrected text is writtern into a new file.
